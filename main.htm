      <p>A spaceship with two astronauts visited earth on August 19, 2016.</p>
      <p>They landed at Ithaca NY, 42.4440° N, 76.5019° W.</p>
      <p>The visit was unexpected, and the visitors did not speak earth language.</p>
      <p>They could not come out of the spacesuit either.</p>
      <p>They stayed for only an hour and left. No one have seen them ever since.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It is still unknown where they come from or who they are.</p>
      <p>They looked like human beings, but why can't they come out of the sapcesuit?</p>
      <p>Are they time travellers? Is the landing only a mistake or are they looking for something?</p>
      <p>Nobody knows the answers yet.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The photographer bumped into the vistors when she was walking home from the supermarket.</p>
      <p>They then walked together for a while in Ithaca, and she took pictures of them.</p>
      <p>To see all the photographs and where they are taken, visit <a href="tour.htm">tour</a> and <a href="gallery.htm">gallery</a>.</p>
